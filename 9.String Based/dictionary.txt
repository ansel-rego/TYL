DICTONARY:
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values
dict1={
    'matches':295
    centuries':50,
    'fifties':300
    }

To print the number of matches played by Virat Kholi
print(dict1['matches'])

To print number of centuries
print(dict1['centuries'])

To print number of fities
print(dict1['fifties'])

This is easier for a new user than printing x[0],x[1],x[2].
In a dictionary, key can be int,float or string. 
dict1.keys() gives all keys of the dictionary.
dict1.values() gives all the values of the dictionary.

Append function doesnt work with dictionary.
To append a new element into a dictionary we need to speicify both key and value.
For example, dict1['runs']=13906
This will append a new key-value pair to the dictionary.
Unlike lists, order does not matter in dictionaries.
Like lists, values of dictionaries can be overwritten.
For example, if Virat Kholi hits 51st century, then we can update the dictionaryas follows:
dict1['centuries']=51

The elements of the list are stored in contiguous(continuous) memory locations.
But contiguous memory locations are not needed to store elements of a dictionary.
This is another advantage of dictionary.

Suppose that there are 100 elements in a list and we want to interest an new element at the 0th index.
Before inserting a new element, we have to shift the existing 100 elements by 1 position.
Similarly, if we delete the element at the 0th index of the list, then we have to shift the remaining 99 elements by 1 position
Hence, insertion and deletion operation are time consuming in a list.
But insertionand deletioncan be done very quicky in a dictionary.
This is another advantage of using dictionaries.

To insert a new eleement in a dictionary:
dict1['avg']=58.65
To delete a element from the dictionary:
dict1.pop('avg')
This will delete the key-value pair whose key is 'avg'.

When we insert or delete elements of a dictionary, we need not alter the position of other eleements of the dictionary.
The only disadvantage of a dictionary is we need memory locations to store both keys and values.
But in a list,index need not be stored.
By default,index values are 0,1,2,.........,len(list1)-1
In a dictionary,keys cannot be repeated, but values can.
If we repeat the keys, the latest key-value pair will be retained.
To initialize a empty dictionary:
dict1={}
